        <p class="leading">Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a software engineer with a penchant for all things web, though I especially love working on front ends. Something about getting things 'just so' gives me that warm fuzzy feeling!</p>

        <p>Genuinely passionate about technology, I have a keen eye for detail and a strong interest in design, user experience and typography. I'm adaptable, easy going and love learning new things. In fact, building this site was a great excuse to finally get some <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> under my belt.</p>

        <p>Recently I've had the chance to work on projects utilising some great new web technology and have really enjoyed the experience, I'm <em>hooked</em> and am looking for more. I feel it's an exciting time to be a developer and involved with technology as the web and the way we interact with it evolves.</p>

        <p>Presently I'm seeking a role that will really push my personal skills and knowledge with opportunities to work with some exciting technology on a variety of compelling projects.</p>

        <h1 class="experience">Experience &amp; Skills<span class="dark">.</span></h1>

        <p>Since graduating in Engineering (Software) &amp; Commerce from Melbourne University in 2007, I have worked for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nab.com.au">NAB</a> over a variety of roles primarily focused on web applications and content management. Throughout these roles I've worked across a number of tools and platforms, details of which are in my <a target="_blank" class="resume-link" href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

        <p>At a high level I'm well versed with software development practices, object oriented programming, design patterns and all phases of the SDLC. Experience across both back and front end web development ensures I am well rounded and comfortable implementing anything from layouts based on designs, front end javascript, integrating dynamic CMS content or debugging services.</p>

        <p>Currently I'm working on an internal administration front end for a mobile payments system utilising <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> hooked into a RESTful backend. Prior to this I developed the refreshed front end for <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="http://www.nabbroker.com.au">Nab Broker</a>, implementing a responsive, cross browser ready website based on an agency design.</p>

        <p>More information can be found on my <a target="_blank" class="resume-link" href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a>, <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=22683660">linkedIn</a> or by <a href="mailto:daan.nguyen@gmail.com">getting in touch</a>.</p>
