        <p class="leading">Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a software engineer with a penchant for all things web, though I especially love working on front ends. Something about getting things 'just so' gives me that warm fuzzy feeling!</p>

        <p>Genuinely passionate about technology, I have a keen eye for detail and a strong interest in design, user experience and typography. I'm adaptable, easy going and love learning new things. In fact, building this site was a great excuse to finally get some <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> under my belt.</p>

        <p>Recently I've had the chance to work on projects utilising some great new web technology and have really enjoyed the experience, I'm <em>hooked</em> and am looking for more. I feel it's an exciting time to be a developer and involved with technology as the web and the way we interact with it evolves.</p>

        <p>Presently I'm seeking a role that will really push my personal skills and knowledge with opportunities to work with some exciting technology on a variety of compelling projects.</p>

      <section id="experience">
        <h1 class="experience">Experience &amp; Skills<span class="dark">.</span></h1>

        <p>Since graduating in Engineering (Software) &amp; Commerce from Melbourne University in 2007, I have worked for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nab.com.au">NAB</a> over a variety of roles primarily focused on web applications and content management. Throughout these roles I've worked across a number of tools and platforms, details of which are in my <a target="_blank" class="resume-link" href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

        <p>At a high level I'm well versed with software development practices, object oriented programming, design patterns and all phases of the SDLC. Experience across both back and front end web development ensures I am well rounded and comfortable implementing anything from layouts based on designs, front end javascript, integrating dynamic CMS content or debugging services.</p>

        <p>Currently I'm working on an internal administration front end for a mobile payments system utilising <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> hooked into a RESTful backend. Prior to this I developed the refreshed front end for <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="http://www.nabbroker.com.au">Nab Broker</a>, implementing a responsive, cross browser ready website based on an agency design.</p>

        <p>More information can be found on my <a target="_blank" class="resume-link" href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a>, <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=22683660">linkedIn</a> or by <a href="mailto:daan.nguyen@gmail.com">getting in touch</a>.</p>

      <section id="personal">
        <h1 class="personal">Let's Get Personal<span class="dark">.</span></h1>
        <p>Beyond my professional life I still really love technology. I enjoy keeping myself up to date on news, gadgets, gaming, technology trends &amp; practices and sometimes just seeing what cool stuff other people have come up with. Sometimes I'll even buy one of these <a target="_blank" href="http://getpebble.com">cool things</a> (I'm still waiting for mine).</p>

        <p>In my spare time I enjoy tinkering. Currently I am playing with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and custom setup NAS to act as a media centre. Previously I've toyed with <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs</a> and <a href="http://socket.io">sockets.io</a> to build real time apps. Although my attempt at a HTML5 canvas <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="http://daan-nguyen.github.io/pong">pong</a> only got so far as single player!</p>

        <p>I also enjoy movies and documentaries, reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.longform.org">long articles</a> or sometimes even <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">random ones</a>, hanging out with friends, cooking and travelling. I snowboard when it's cold and I (try) to keep fit when it's warm.</p>

      <section id="other">
        <h1 class="other">Other Tidbits<span class="dark">.</span></h1>
        <p>Built from scratch using HTML5 + CSS3, <a target="_blank" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation CSS</a> was used as a jumping point not only because I find it lighter than <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, but also the <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com">sass</a> version means only the necessary components are imported.</p>

        <p>Other useful bits and bobs include the ubiquitous <a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://modernizr.com">modernizr</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://conditionizr.com">conditionizr</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://fittextjs.com">fitText</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass">normalize.css</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">Google Web Fonts</a> (Roboto, Bree Serif, Open Sans) &amp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.entypo.com/">entypo</a> for icons.</p>

        <p>Cross browser compatible, it's <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/?url=http://daan-nguyen.github.io" target="_blank" class="track-link">responsive</a> with a focus on ensuring readability at various viewport sizes. Also, as I've hosted on <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, the source can be found in my <a target="_blank" class="track-link" href="https://github.com/daan-nguyen/daan-nguyen.github.com">repo</a>.</p>

        <p>And finally all this was built in my favourite editor, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> was also very useful to handle build functions. It also auto-refreshes on changes, which although minor is pretty amazingly useful.</p>
