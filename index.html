          <p class="leading">Hi, I'm Dan. I'm a software engineer with a penchant for all things web, though I especially have a passion for front end development. Something about getting things 'just so' gives me that warm fuzzy feeling!</p>

          <p>Genuinely passionate about technology, I have a keen eye for detail and a strong interest in design, user experience and typography. I'm adaptable, easy going and love learning new things. In fact, building this site was a great excuse to finally get some <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> under my belt.</p>

          <p>Recently I've had the chance to work on projects utilising some great new web technology and I must say I'm <em>hooked</em>. It's an exciting time to be a developer I believe, particularly developing for the evolving multi-device web.</p>

          <p>Currently I'm looking for a role with opportunities to not only push my personal skills and knowledge, but one with an opportunity to really work at the edge of emerging technology, tools and practices on a wide variety of compelling projects. I'd love to <a href="#contact">have a chat</a>.</p>

          <h2>Experience &amp; Skills</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>Since graduating in Engineering (Software) &amp; Commerce from Melbourne University in 2007, I have worked for <a href="http://www.nab.com.au">NAB</a> over a variety of roles primarily focused on web applications and content management. Throughout these roles I've worked across a number of tools and platforms, details of which are in my <a href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

          <p>At a high level I'm well versed and have been involved with all phases of the SDLC, software development practices, object oriented programming and design patterns.</p>

          <p>Currently I'm working on an internal administration front end for a mobile payments system utilising <a href="http://www.angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> hooked into a RESTful backend. Prior to this I developed the refreshed front end for <a href="http://www.nabbroker.com.au">Nab Broker</a>, implementing a responsive, cross browser ready website based on an agency design.</p>

          <p>You'll find more details on my <a href="dan-nguyen-resume.pdf">resume</a> or my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=22683660">linkedIn</a>.</p>

          <h2>Myself</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>Beyond my professional life I still really love technology. I enjoy keeping myself up to date on news, gadgets, gaming, technology trends &amp; practices and sometimes just seeing what cool stuff other people have come up with. Sometimes I'll even buy one of these <a href="http://getpebble.com">cool things</a> (I'm still waiting).</p>

          <p>In my spare time I enjoy tinkering. Currently I am playing with a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and custom setup NAS to act as a media centre. Previously I've toyed with <a href="http://nodejs.org">nodejs</a> and <a href="http://socket.io">sockets</a> to build real time apps. Although my attempt at a HTML5 canvas <a href="http://daan-nguyen.github.io/pong">pong</a> only got so far as single player!</p>

          <p>I also enjoy movies and documentaries, reading <a href="http://www.longform.org">long articles</a> or sometimes even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">random ones</a>, hanging out with friends and travelling. I snowboard when it's cold and I (try) to keep fit when it's warm.</p>

      <section id="aboutthissite">
        <header>
          <h2>This Site</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
          <p>Built from scratch, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation CSS</a> as a jumping point not only because I find it lighter than <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, but also the <a href="">sass</a> version means only the necessary components are used.</p>

          <p>Other useful bits and bobs include the ubiquitous <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://modernizr.com">modernizr</a>, <a href="http://conditionizr.com">conditionizr</a>, <a href="http://fittextjs.com">fitText</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize.css-with-sass-or-compass">normalize.css</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">Google Web Fonts</a> (Roboto, Bree Serif, Open Sans) & <a href="http://www.entypo.com/">entypo</a> for icons.</p>

          <p>The site will use CSS3 transitions where available and fall back to jQuery based animation when it's not. Cross browser compatible, it's responsive with a focus on ensuring readability at various viewport sizes. Also, as I've hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, the source can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/daan-nguyen/daan-nguyen.github.com">repo</a>.</p>

          <p>And finally all this was built in my favourite editor, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>. <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> was also very useful to handle build functions. It also auto-refreshes on changes, which although minor is pretty amazingly useful.</p>
